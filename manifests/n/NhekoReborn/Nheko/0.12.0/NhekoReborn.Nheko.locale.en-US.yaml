ShortDescription: Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++20.
Description: The motivation behind the project is to provide a native desktop app for Matrix that feels more like a mainstream chat app (Element, Telegram etc) and less like an IRC client.

  Notes
  The packages for windows are split into an appinstaller file with autoupdates
  and an msix, which can be installed directly and won't check for updates. The
  appimage is currently disabled until someone ports it to Qt6. The flatpak appid
  changed and you will need to migrate manually.
  For packagers most of our dependencies have been changed or updated. Most
  significantly Nheko now depends on KDSingleApplication and Qt6.
  Highlights
  - Qt6 6Ô∏è‚É£
    - This release migrates to version 6 of the Qt toolkit.
    - This brings various changes to Nheko. Scrolling might feel slower on some
      platforms. Theming will look different. You have been warned!
    - We left out all the fixes we had to do for this from the changelog.
      Otherwise it might have been twice as long...
  - Intentional mentions üîî
    - You can now decide if a message should mention someone or not.
    - Replies now also include an explicit mention (MSC4142).
  - Event expiration ‚è≤Ô∏è
    - You can now make Nheko delete messages regularly.
    - Configure either a time or a maximum number of messages.
    - Can be configured per room or globally.
  - Ignoring users (NepNep) üîï
    - You can now ignore other users.
    - This will hide their messages from the timeline.
    - You can either user the /ignore command, the button in their profile or
      the button in the Nheko settings.
